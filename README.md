Project description:<br>
The CISE Committee Manager is a web application intended to assist the Computer Science Engineering Department faculty and staff in managing committees. Each user of this web application will have a unique log in that allows them to view their committee information, including a description, schedule, members list and agenda for specific meeting. This project was assigned by Alin Dobra for a Software Engineering Course at the University of Florida. 
<br><br>
Features:<br>
The features implemented in this application include:

- <b>Log in:</b> Admin, Staff and Faculty log in ability. Each of the three roles allow for different functionality based on the level of access the specific user has.
- <b>Create committee:</b> Ability to create a new committee. Upon creation Admin can designate a commitee chair.
- <b>Edit committee:</b> Ability to edit a committee. The Admin or Committee Chair can add and delete memebers from a committee and edit the description of the committee. Admin's are also able to delete a committee and all of its related objects (meetings and schedules).
- <b>Create meeting:</b> The Admin or Committee Chair can create a meeting for a committee using a date and time picker. In addition to specifying the time of the meeting, the user can also designate a notetaker for the specific meeting.
- <b>Attendance and Notetaking</b> When in a meeting, the Committee Chair can take attendance and save. If the user is the note taker, they can also take notes for the meeting. Agenda Items that have been discussed can also be checked off the list and saved.
- <b>Agenda Items</b> Users can also create agenda items to be discussed in a meeting. Any user can create an agenda item to be possibly discussed, a committee chair can decide to move the agenda item to a vote or to allow, and the agenda item will populate on the meeting page to be checked off once discussed.
